# [Ludum Dare 24: UNBOUND](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=14296)
This was my entry for the Ludum Dare 24 Compo, which took place August 24th-27th 2012. The jam's theme was **Evolution**.

This game was built using [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org/) 0.8.0.

Original submission description:

> UNBOUND is a story spanning two time periods: July of 1963 and the summer of 1993. Enticed by a myth about a man named Daniel McArthur, you, a curious journalist, venture into what remains of the Daniel McArthur's last reported assignment.
>
> In this game, I took a different approach to "evolution" -- here, it is mental evolution. Your emotions may evolve similarly to how Daniel's did.
>
> Use WASD to move, hold left shift to sprint, and click on notes to read them. Read every note you find, they are important.
>
> The story should take no longer than 10 minutes to complete. I would appreciate it if you finish it if at all possible.
