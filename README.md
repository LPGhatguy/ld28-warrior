# [Ludum Dare 28: Warrior](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-28/?action=preview&uid=14296)
This was my wife and I's entry for the Ludum Dare 28 Jam, which took place December 13th-16th 2013. The jam's theme was **You Only Get One**.

This game was built using [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org/) 0.9.0.

Original `readme.txt`:

```
      HERE BE DRAGONS

        HERE LIES
     WARRIOR (LD#28)
   DECEMBER 13TH, 2013
           TO
   DECEMBER 16TH, 2013
           RIP

Really, this source code is purely jam code.
It's awful, but it works.
It did its job and did it will.
It will be remembered.

Original submission description:

> Warrior is a one-button fighting game featuring a samurai, a knight, and a viking. The gameplay is intended to be clunky and ridiculous, featuring randomness, but in such a way that it doesn't impede skillful players.
>
> The game is intended for two players, but an AI is included for single player mode. The difficulty of the AI is strange; mileage may vary.
>
> You can use literally any button to play the game, including keyboard keys, mouse buttons, and game controller buttons. Playing with your friends is encouraged!
>
> For platforms other than Windows, download LOVE 0.9.0 from http://love2d.org/ and run the .love file using it. Possible Android port coming soon!
>
> Thanks to Lafolie for help with the Mac OS X port!
